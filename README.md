# 🏁 LastButNotLeast

> The fastest way to give up — now with **zero bugs!**

**LastButNotLeast** is a proudly unhelpful automated theorem prover, built to participate in the [CADE ATP System Competition (CASC)](https://tptp.org/CASC/).

It might just be the fastest prover in the competition —  not at solving problems, but at knowing when to quit.

### ✨ Features

- ✅ Runs flawlessly  
- ❌ Achieves absolutely nothing  
- 💯 100% success rate in failure  
- ∞ Zero proofs, infinite potential  
- 👕 Proudly earns you a cool CASC T-shirt

> _Warning:_ Developing this prover may require sharing meals with very strange people. But hey — that’s the price of innovation.

## 🧠 Strategy

The strategy is as elegant as it is ineffective: always return `GaveUp`.

It’s fast. It’s reliable. It guarantees that we never solve anything — by design.

---

## 💻 Implementation

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

print("% LastButNotLeast: The fastest way to give up!")
print("% For best results, do not expect results.")
print("% SZS status GaveUp")
print("% It's not a bug — it's a philosophical stance.")
print("% Thanks for trying LastButNotLeast :)")
```

---


## 🚀 Usage

Run the prover from the command line:

```bash
$ python lastbutnotleast.py problem.p
```

Expected output:

```
% LastButNotLeast: The fastest way to give up!
% For best results, do not expect results.
% SZS status GaveUp
% It's not a bug — it's a philosophical stance.
% Thanks for trying LastButNotLeast :)
```

Best used when you want to submit *something* to CASC, but not necessarily solve anything.

## 📊 Expected Competition Performance

**LastButNotLeast** is designed to come in last.  
Any other result would be genuinely surprising — possibly even concerning.

It exists to ensure no other prover, no matter how underwhelming, must carry the burden of being last.
