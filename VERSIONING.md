# 🧪 Joke-style Semantic Versioning for LastButNotLeast

LastButNotLeast follows the **Ironic Semantic Versioning (ISemVer)** convention:

```v[LEVEL_OF_FAILURE].[FREQUENCY_OF_GIVING_UP].[NUMBER_OF_PEOPLE_WHO_TRIED_TO_FIX_IT_AND_FAILED]```

## 🧾 Examples

- `v1.0.0` — First failure. No attempts at fixing. Pure.
- `v2.3.5` — Now fails even more frequently, with 5 confirmed failed rescue attempts.
- `v0.0.0` — A true masterpiece of nothingness.
- `v4.42.9001` — It's not just broken, it's *meaning-of-life* broken and *over 9000* beyond help.

This versioning system ensures maximum confusion while preserving the illusion of order — just like the prover itself.
