<P>
<b>LastButNotLeast</b>: The fastest way to give up — now with 0 bugs! <br/>
Probably the fastest prover in the competition:
<ul>
    <li>Runs flawlessly.</li>
    <li>Achieves absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li>100% success rate in failure.</li>
    <li>Zero proof, infinite potential.</li>
    <li>Proudly earns you a cool CASC T-shirt.</li>
</ul>
Unfortunately, designing this prover may force you to share a meal with very weird people — but hey, that's the price of true innovation.


<H3>Strategies</H3>

The strategy is simple: always return <code>GaveUp</code>. It’s fast, reliable, and guarantees we never solve anything—by design.


<H3>Implementation</H3>
<code>
#!/usr/bin/env python<br />

print("% LastButNotLeast: The fastest way to give up!") <br/>
print("% For best results, do not expect results.")<br />
print("% SZS status GaveUp")<br />
print("% It's not a bug — it's a philosophical stance.")<br />
print("% Thanks for trying LastButNotLeast :)")<br />
</code>


<H3>Expected Competition Performance</H3>

The prover is expected to come last, and any other result would be genuinely surprising — possibly even concerning.<br/>
In fact, <b>LastButNotLeast</b> proudly exists to ensure that no other prover—no matter how underwhelming—has to carry the
burden of being last.
